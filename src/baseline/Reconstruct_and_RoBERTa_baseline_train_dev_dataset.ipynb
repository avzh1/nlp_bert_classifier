Some human beings are totally inclined to the pursuit of virtue , and are consumed with desire for knowledge of the Divine World , known as m \\' arifat , or gnosis . Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world . There is a middle , order of persons who have inclination to gnosis , and also have aptitude for worldly , affairs . This last category is described by Imam Razi , writing in the 12th century , as \"\" the people of the right hand or the balanced people \"\" , and to such persons , control over the affairs of their fellowmen rightly belongs . The task is never easy ; mere goodness is no guarantee for success . Possession of all the virtues alone is not sufficient . There must be inspiration from a higher source . The element of marifat provides the necessary directions , by holding the attention to the Divine light . No leader of any community who has gained success in managing its affairs and certainly no leader who led his people out of bondage , or saved them from the threat of hopeless submergence under a majority , hostile to them , can ever have done so by the exercise of mere human intelligence , or brain power or character .\"',\n",

But their plan was not to be . Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities , the 600 or so men now await deportation , prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers . Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate . Several days ago , the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies . \"\" I came from Djibouti to work . They used to give us small amounts of food . If there is no food , we will die , \"\" said one migrant who declined to give his name . \"\" If there is no solution , they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here \"\" , the man added . Yemen , the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula , has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa , many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence . The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all-out war in 2015 . Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey , and those who make it face multiple risks , including death by \"\" assault , extortion and abuse by criminal networks , as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself \"\" , according to UNHCR , the United Nations \\' refugee agency . Despite these dangers , the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily , to 117,000 in 2016 from 92,000 in 2015 , according to UNHCR . Khaled al-Elwany , a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries , says up to 15,000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month . Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies . A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation . Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen \\'s exiled government to power and roll back the Iran-aligned Houthi movement . While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas , a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad . State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos , and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority . The frightened men in the Aden warehouse , subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish-strewn outdoor space , are just the tip of the iceberg .\"',\n",
