"Islamic philosophy has dealt at length with the study of inherent mental qualities and inclinations among human beings with special reference to moral virtue . Some human beings are totally inclined to the pursuit of virtue , and are consumed with desire for knowledge of the Divine World , known as m ' arifat , or gnosis . Others tend to be carried away by the things and pleasures of the world . There is a middle , order of persons who have inclination to gnosis , and also have aptitude for worldly , affairs . This last category is described by Imam Razi , writing in the 12th century , as "" the people of the right hand or the balanced people "" , and to such persons , control over the affairs of their fellowmen rightly belongs . The task is never easy ; mere goodness is no guarantee for success . Possession of all the virtues alone is not sufficient . There must be inspiration from a higher source . The element of marifat provides the necessary directions , by holding the attention to the Divine light . No leader of any community who has gained success in managing its affairs and certainly no leader who led his people out of bondage , or saved them from the threat of hopeless submergence under a majority , hostile to them , can ever have done so by the exercise of mere human intelligence , or brain power or character ."	hopeless	pk	1

If vote-buying is allowed to affect both voter turnout and choice , then political accountability and equality are at risk . This is particularly the case given the disproportionate influence of vote-buying on the most vulnerable members of the society that arguably have a greater need than the community in which they reside . Given that this group is most likely to be the people that vote on election day , they will have an overwhelming impact on the election result . Elected officials , therefore , will have no one to be accountable to . This is both because it can be said they have already paid for their post and also because they were not elected based on their accountability .	vulnerable	jm	0

Rounding up refugee families at schools , churches , homes seems inconsistent with American principles which , over decades , have assisted migrants , granting refugee status to those fleeing countries with corrupt governments . Cubans , since the 60s , have been granted refugee status as they come from a Government deemed by the USA as corrupt and repressive ; 50 years have lapsed and the Cubans still enjoy visa-free entry to the USA .	refugee	jm	0

Careful here . The way society has changed has upset many people and we unfairly mock these concerns .

In the case of Sri Lanka , the significance of migration to the balance of payments and the economy is of such a magnitude that the Sri Lankan economy has been described as a remittance-dependent economy . About 80 % of the huge trade deficit of US$ 5.2 billion in 2010 was offset by remittances from abroad . It is estimated that remittances contributed 8 % to GDP in 2008 . The situation in Sri Lanka is very similar with Bangladesh , Nepal and Pakistan , where remittances are not only a support to the trade balance but an important way by which the country 's poverty is alleviated . A large proportion of the outflow consists of women domestic workers who have been vulnerable in destination countries . Families receiving remittances invest more in housing , education , and health care , but there are also social costs including child abuse , school drop-outs and family break-ups as a result of family separation . Therefore the effects of out-migration are mixed .	vulnerable	lk	0
